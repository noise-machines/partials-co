## Overview
Our website is built on Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit), a framework for writing great web apps.

## Quickstart

`gulp serve` to run a development server on your machine.

`gulp serve:dist` to run the optimized deployment version of the app.

`gulp` to build the app for deployment.

`firebase deploy` to upload the most recent build to Firebase.

See the [commands](docs/commands.md) documentation for more details.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing your changes when running `gulp serve:dist` or after deploying, open the URL in an incognito window or clear your cache.

If you run into build problems, you may need to run

`npm install imagemin`

and / or

`npm install phantomjs`
